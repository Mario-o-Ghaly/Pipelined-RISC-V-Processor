Our implementation supported all the instructions correctly.

We verified the functionallity of the processor by writing various test cases to test each of instruction types.

We verified the functionallity of the program on the FPGA.

We implemented these bonus features and they work correctly:
1. Add support for integer multiplication and division to effectively support the full RV32IM instruction set.
2. Provide another solution to handle the structural hazard introduced by using a single single-ported memory.

We also tried to provide a test program generator, but it does not support all the instruction types.
